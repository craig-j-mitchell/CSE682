** This describes the functional and nonfunctional requirements in more detail. If necessary,
further detail may also be added to the nonfunctional requirements. Interfaces to other
systems may be defined. **

1.1     Data Acquisition: The system should be capable of receiving and processing real-time data inputs concerning inventory movement. This includes sales data, product returns, purchases from suppliers, and warehouse transfers. This may involve integration with Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, online sales platforms, and procurement modules.

1.2     Inventory Database: The system must have a robust and scalable database to store inventory data including SKU, product name, description, cost, selling price, quantity in stock, re-order level, and supplier details.

1.3    Data Synchronization: The system should be able to synchronize data across all platforms and stores (both online and physical stores) to ensure the inventory level is updated in real-time.

1.4    Notification Mechanism: The system should have an alert mechanism to notify relevant staff when the stock level of a certain item falls below the re-order point. This may involve email, SMS, or push notifications.

1.5    Reporting Capability: The system should be able to generate real-time reports showing current stock levels, fast-moving items, slow-moving items, and out-of-stock items. Reports should be exportable in common formats like CSV, Excel, or PDF.

1.6    Data Accuracy: The system should have error-checking algorithms to ensure the accuracy of inventory data, for instance by checking for anomalies or inconsistencies.

1.7    Security: The system should have access controls and audit trails to ensure only authorized personnel can access and modify the inventory data, providing transparency and accountability.

1.8    Scalability: The system must be designed to handle an increasing number of products and transaction volume as the business grows.

1.9    Data Backup and Recovery: The system must have a robust backup and recovery mechanism to ensure data can be restored in the event of data loss.

1.10    User Interface: The system should provide a user-friendly interface to display real-time inventory data, provide easy access to different functions, and allow users to quickly search and update the inventory.

2.1    Purchase Order Management: The system should allow users to create, send, and track purchase orders to suppliers. Purchase order details should be automatically reflected in the inventory forecast.

2.2    Delivery Scheduling and Tracking: The system should have a mechanism to schedule and track deliveries from suppliers, including estimated delivery time and real-time status updates. This may require integration with delivery management systems or logistics providers' systems.

2.3    Supplier Database: The system must be capable of storing and managing supplier details such as name, contact details, product lines, pricing, and delivery terms.

2.4    Receiving and Inspection: The system should allow users to record the receipt of goods, including the quantity received, inspection results, and any discrepancies or quality issues.

2.5    Automatic Update: Upon receipt of goods, the system should automatically update the inventory levels, reflecting the new stock quantities.

2.6    Supplier Performance Tracking: The system should be able to track supplier performance metrics, such as delivery time reliability, quality issue frequency, and order accuracy.

2.7    Integration with Accounting Systems: The system should be integrated with accounting systems to automatically update accounts payable upon receipt of goods and to track payments made to suppliers.

2.8    Alert Mechanism: The system should have a notification mechanism to alert the user about delayed deliveries, due payments, or other important supplier-related issues.

2.9    Reporting Capability: The system should be able to generate supplier performance reports, delivery schedules, purchase history, and pending orders.

2.10    User Interface: The system should provide a user-friendly interface for users to easily manage and track orders, deliveries, and supplier information.
